# gif-portal-starter-svelte
This is for people that would like to follow this amazing tutorial but would like to use Sveltekit as their framework!

# Setup
1. Run the command ``npm install`` or ``npm i`` in the root directory!
2. Run the command ``npm run dev`` to start a local server!
3. Follow the tutorial made by Buildspace https://buildspace.so/p/build-solana-web3-app/lessons/what-are-we-building, and be aware that Buildspace is using React so you will have to implement the things that they are teaching a bit different. If you have trouble the discord server is full of people that might be able to help you. Else it is a very good learning experience to solve your own problems!
